Certainly! Here are 25 structure-related problems categorized by label:

1. Basic Structure Operations:
   a. Write a program to define a structure representing a student with attributes like name, roll number, and age.
   b. Write a program to define a structure representing a point in a 2D space with attributes x and y coordinates.
   c. Write a program to define a structure representing a date with attributes day, month, and year.

2. Structure Initialization:
   a. Write a program to initialize a structure variable with default values.
   b. Write a program to initialize a structure variable with user-input values.

3. Structure Functions:
   a. Write a program to pass a structure to a function and modify its attributes.
   b. Write a program to pass a structure to a function and return a structure.

4. Nested Structures:
   a. Write a program to define a structure representing a circle with attributes center (a point structure) and radius.
   b. Write a program to define a structure representing a book with attributes title, author (a structure representing the author details), and publication year.

5. Structure Arrays:
   a. Write a program to define an array of structures representing a list of students.
   b. Write a program to define an array of structures representing a list of employees with attributes like name, id, and salary.

   a. Write a program to allocate memory dynamically for a structure using pointers.
   b. Write a program to access structure members using structure pointers.

7. Structure Sorting and Searching:
   a. Write a program to sort an array of structures based on a specific attribute (e.g., sorting students by roll number).
   b. Write a program to search for a specific value in an array of structures (e.g., searching for a student by name).

8. Structure File Operations:
   a. Write a program to read and write structures to a file.
   b. Write a program to search for a specific structure in a file based on an attribute value.

9. Structure Comparisons:
   a. Write a program to compare two structures for equality (e.g., comparing two points in a 2D space).
   b. Write a program to compare two structures for ordering (e.g., comparing two dates).

10. Structure Operations:
    a. Write a program to perform arithmetic operations on structures (e.g., adding two points in a 2D space).
    b. Write a program to calculate the distance between two points in a 2D space using structures.

These structure-related problems cover a range of concepts and operations involving structures in C programming. They will help you practice and improve your understanding of working with structures. Good luck with your programming!
