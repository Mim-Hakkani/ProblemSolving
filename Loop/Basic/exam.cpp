Take two natural numbers X and Y. If X * Y = Z, is Z even or odd when X and Y -


(Case 1) both are even: even / odd

(Case 2) both are odd: even / odd

(Case 3) One of them is odd, the other one is even: even / odd




For Case 1 : 

       if both are even 

       let x = 10
           y = 4

           x*y = z

           z = x*y
           z = 10*4 
           z = 40 

           we know that a number or z is even when z%2 = 0

           in this equation , see that  z = 40 is 40%2 = 0 so 
           z is even number always 

           so finally we say that ,

            even * even = even 



Case 2 : 

 if both are odd 

       let x = 3
           y = 5

           x*y = z

           z = x*y
           z = 3*5 
           z = 15

           we know that a number or z is odd when z%2 = 1

           in this equation , see that  z = 15 is 15%2 = 1 so 
           z is odd number always 

          so we say that odd * odd = odd 


Case 3: 
  One of them is odd, the other one is even: even / odd


       let x = 4
           y = 5

           x*y = z

           z = x*y
           z = 4*5 
           z = 40

           we know that a number or z is odd when z%2 = 1 or a number or z is even when z%2 = 0

           in this case we see that 
            
            even * odd  = even  => 5 * 4 = 40 that is even 
            odd * even  = even  => 4 * 5 = 40 that is even

           in this equation , see that  z = 40 is 40%2 = 0 so 
           z is even number always 

final Case 
  
   one is odd and another is odd  that the number is = odd 

   5 * 5 = 25 is odd 
   3 * 7  = 21 is odd
