Certainly! Here are 10 easy sorting and searching problems that you can solve using C:

1. Write a program to sort an array of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
2. Write a program to sort an array of integers in descending order using the selection sort algorithm.
3. Write a program to sort an array of integers in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.
4. Write a program to search for a specific element in an array of integers using linear search.
5. Write a program to search for a specific element in a sorted array of integers using binary search.
6. Write a program to find the maximum element in an array of integers using linear search.
7. Write a program to find the minimum element in an array of integers using linear search.
8. Write a program to count the occurrences of a specific element in an array of integers.
9. Write a program to find the sum of all elements in an array of integers.
10. Write a program to find the average of all elements in an array of integers.

These sorting and searching problems will help you practice the basic concepts and algorithms of sorting and searching in C programming. Good luck with your coding!
