/*
Update the following code so that the values in array b is ‘x’ more than the corresponding values in array a. You can only write only one line of code inside the loop (in the comment section mark
“Write Code Here”). Do not modify anything else.  	

int n = 10;
int x = 5;
int index = 0;
int a[] = {12, 7, 3, 71, 2, 43, 38, 23, 45, 22};
int b[n];
for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
	//Write Code Here
    
   if(a[i]>5) b[i] = a[i];

char s = “america”
What is wrong with this C statement. Mark the errors and fix them. 

1.No semicolon added to break this statements 
2.if this is the type of character then only one charcter in this statement but we declare more chracter and also not declare the the array because of more character 

solution : 
char s[] = "america" ;
********************************************************************
3.
Suppose you want to declare an array of size 15 and the elements of the array will be in a geometric progression, the first one starting with 1 and the common ratio being 2. For example, the first few elements of that array will be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 , … and so on. Write a for loop to initialize the array with the  required progression.
